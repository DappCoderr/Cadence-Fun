Hey there! Before we dive into the Flow Playground and start building, let's make sure you're on the same page when it comes to blockchain basics. If you're new to blockchain, take a quick look at [here](https://developers.flow.com/build/basics/blocks).

In this lesson, we'll embark on a fun adventure to build the Knight game using the Flow Playground. If you're new to Flow, don't worry! There's a quick tutorial to get you up to speed [playground](<(https://youtu.be/pRz7EzrWchs?si=bodusfeIHzgHPrV6&t=158)>).

**So, what is Cadence, anyway?**

Cadence is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Flow blockchain. Think of it as a special tool for building the rules and logic that make blockchain apps work.

**Why use Cadence?**

- **Safety First:** Cadence helps prevent mistakes in your code, making your smart contracts more reliable.
- **Digital Asset Management:** It's like having a digital safe for your assets on the blockchain.
- **Rules and Regulations:** Cadence has built-in checks to make sure your smart contracts follow the right rules.
- **Permissions and Security:** You can control who can do what with your digital assets.
- **Easy to Learn:** If you've used languages like Swift, Kotlin, or Rust, Cadence will feel familiar.

In short, Cadence is a powerful and user-friendly tool for building smart contracts.
