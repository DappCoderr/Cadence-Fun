Let's dive into the Knight Game! Picture it like a multiplayer Pokémon battle, where two Pokémon duke it out, and the stronger one wins. Now, apply that idea to the Knight Game! Each knight you play is extraordinary. These knights are like your personal digital collectibles, living in your account on the Flow blockchain. Just think of them as your digital superheroes!

In Module 3, you'll be crafting a smart contract for these knights. This contract allows you to do some really cool stuff, such as creating a brand-new knight just for yourself. Each knight comes with its own special attributes (ID, XP, win count and details):

- #### ID: It's like a unique code for each knight.
- #### Details: This holds the knight's name, creation date, and what type of knight it is.
- #### XP: This shows how powerful your knight is.
- #### Win Count: It keeps track of how many battles your knight has won.

Ok, that’s enough overview. Now you're ready to continue, hit "Next Chapter" below, and let's dive into learning Cadence!
