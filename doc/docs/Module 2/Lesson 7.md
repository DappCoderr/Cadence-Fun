Congratulations! You've grasped the fundamentals of resources, structs, and their powerful combination in Flow contracts. Now, let's enhance your KnightNFT resource by adding more details that can influence gameplay!

### Environmental Advantage

Imagine a game where knights have an advantage when fighting in environments that match their training. We can represent this by adding a new property to the KnightDetails struct that specifies the knight's environment (e.g., grass, fire, water, rock).

### Put it to the Test

1. Open Flow [Playground](https://play.flow.com/)
2. In `KnightDetails` create a new public variable named `env` (of type String)
