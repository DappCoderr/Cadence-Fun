Welcome! Before we jump into Cadence and the Flow Playground, let's make sure you are familiar with blockchain basics teams like block, smart contracts and transactions etc. If you're new to these, take a moment to brush up on [these](https://developers.flow.com/build/basics/blocks) fundamentals for a smoother ride.

In this module, we're off on a fun adventure building the Knight game using the Flow Playground. If you're new to Flow, no worries! Watch a quick tutorial to get comfy with the [playground](<(https://youtu.be/pRz7EzrWchs?si=bodusfeIHzgHPrV6&t=158)>).
