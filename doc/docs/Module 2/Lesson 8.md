Great Job!!
you have learned a lot so far. Now let's add one more variable to Knight to make it's different identity like spartan, vikings, Stark Kingdom, Arryn Kingdom, Lannister Kingdom, Night King etc.

### Put it to the Test

1. Open Flow [Playground](https://play.flow.com/)
2. In `KnightDetails` create a new public variable named `types` (of type String)
