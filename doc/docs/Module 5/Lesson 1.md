Hey there, champion! We're nearing the end of our grand adventure in Module 5! Remember how we built our awesome Knight and learned to keep it safe? This time, we're about to uncover something even cooler!

Get ready to hear all about **special tokens**! You might've heard about tokens before in the blockchain world. But here's the catch: we're focusing on a unique kind called **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**. Think of them as one-of-a-kind treasures, not your average everyday tokens!

And that's not all! We'll also be exploring the exciting world of battle logic and something called the Flow VRF. Sounds mysterious, right? âœ¨

Ready to jump into Module 5 and discover all the fun stuff waiting for us? Let's go!
