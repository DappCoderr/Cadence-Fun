Welcome to Module 4 of our series! ðŸŽ‰

So far, we've covered a lot and even built our own Knight.

Now, get ready for something really cool! In Module 4, we're going to talk about tokens. You might have heard about tokens if you've been in the blockchain space for a while â€” specifically, fungible tokens. But here's the twist â€“ we're focusing on a special type called non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Think of NFTs as unique digital items, similar to rare trading cards or one-of-a-kind artworks.

Exciting, right?

Let's dive into Module 4 and discover all the fun stuff waiting for us! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
