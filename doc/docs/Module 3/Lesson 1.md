Hey there adventurer! Welcome back to Module 3!

Remember that awesome Knight you created? Now, get ready for a special place to store it, like your own personal wardrobe in your house!

**Forget the crowded bank!** Unlike some other places (like Ethereum), where everything goes into one big storage locker, Flow lets you have your own secure space. This means your Knight (and other cool stuff you create) gets its own private home.

### Understanding Account & Storage:

![Alt text](image.png)

Imagine your Flow account as a two-story building:

- Contract (Up-stairs): This is where all the programs (called contracts) you create live.
- Storage (Down-stairs): This is your personal space in your account (like a personal wardrobe in your house), accessed through a special `path: /storage/` Here, you can keep all sorts of valuables, like your Knight NFT.

:::note
Paths like /storage/ act like special instructions that tell the system exactly where to find information. Just like your home address helps mail carriers deliver letters, the path helps locate your specific storage area within your Flow account.

### Levels of Access: Organizing Your Storage!

Your Storage has 3 different paths:

- `/storage/`: This is the most private area. Only YOU have the key to access everything stored here. (Like only you have the key to your personal closet.)
- `/public/`: Think of this as a closet with glass doors. Anyone can see what's inside it. But they can not access it.
- `/private/`: Think of this as sharing access with close ones. Only you and those you allow can access what's stored inside.

Ah! We've learned a lot. Now, let's move forward.

As we explore further, you'll learn how to move your Knight from a shared space to your very own vault. Exciting, right?

Get ready for Module 3, where lots of cool things await! Let's make the Flow world your own! âœ¨
