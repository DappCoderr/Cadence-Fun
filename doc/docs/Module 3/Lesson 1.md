Imagine your Flow account as a two-story building:

- Upstairs (Contract): This is where all the programs (contracts) live.
- Downstairs (Storage): This is your personal space, accessed through a special path: /storage/. Here, you can keep all your valuables, like your Knight NFT.

Paths like /storage/ act like special instructions that tell the system exactly where to find information. Just like your home address helps mail carriers deliver letters, the path helps locate your specific storage area within your Flow account.
