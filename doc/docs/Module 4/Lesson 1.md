Welcome to Module 4 of our series! ðŸŽ‰

So far, we've learned a lot and even created our own Knight.

Now, get ready for something really interesting! In Module 4, we'll talk about flow accounts. Cadence, the language we're using, is a bit different from what you might be used to. Here, instead of storing your stuff in a shared place like a safe deposit box, you get your own personal storage space. It's like having your own room rather than sharing a dorm. This is unlike Ethereum, where your digital items are usually kept in a shared safe. But in Cadence, if you own something, it's kept in your own personal space. As we move forward, we'll learn how to put our Knight directly into our personal space instead of in a shared one.

Exciting, right?

Let's jump into Module 4 and explore all the cool things waiting for us! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
