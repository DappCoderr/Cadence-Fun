Welcome to Module 4 of our series! ðŸŽ‰

We've learned a lot so far and even made our own Knight. Now, get ready for something cool! In Module 4, we'll talk about flow accounts. In Cadence, it's a bit different than what you might expect. Instead of storing your things in a shared place like a safe deposit box, you get your own space. It's like having your own room instead of sharing a dorm. Unlike Ethereum, where items are stored together, in Cadence, if you own something, it's in your personal space. As we go on, we'll learn how to put our Knight directly into our own space instead of sharing one.

Exciting, right?

Let's jump into Module 4 and see all the cool stuff waiting for us! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
