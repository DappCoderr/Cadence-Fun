Welcome to Module 4 of our series! ðŸŽ‰

So far, we've covered a lot and even built our own Knight.

Now, get ready for something really cool! In Module 4, we're going to talk about tokens. You might have heard about tokens if you've been in the blockchain space for a while â€” specifically, fungible tokens. But here's the twist â€“ we're focusing on a special type called non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Think of NFTs as unique digital items, similar to rare trading cards or one-of-a-kind artworks.

Exciting, right?

Let's dive into Module 4 and discover all the fun stuff waiting for us! ðŸ’ªâœ¨

In this lesson, we're going to talk about using a special kind of token to represent Knights. These tokens are designed specifically, making each item complete one unique piece and not possible to break into smaller parts. You can only trade whole Knights, and each Knight has its own special ID number.

You might wonder why we need these tokens when we already have resources. Well, standard provide some special set of rules like minting, storage etc, it's like interface which helps you to build NFT easily.
